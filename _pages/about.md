I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Center of Statistical Sciences at Peking University under the supervision of Professor [Wei Lin](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/linw/). I received my bachelor's degree from School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University in 2021.
I am interested in statistics and machine learning.

My research interest primarily lies at the intersection of statistics and machine learning. Specifically, I currently focus on theory of pre-training and data fusion with heterogeneity.
